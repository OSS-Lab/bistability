Model: Elementary enzyme catalysis: S -> P
The deficiency of the reaction network is 1.
The reaction network deficiency is greater than the sum of the deficiencies of its linkage classes, so Deficiency-One Theorem does not apply.
The network is regular and the Deficiency-One Algorithm determines that the reaction network with mass action kinetics does not admit multiple positive equilibria within a stoichiometric compatibility class.
The reaction network with mass action or Michaelis-Menten kinetics is non-autocatalytic.
The stoichiometric matrix is SSD. With said kinetics, the Jacobian matrix of the system of ODEs is a P0(-) matrix, so the reaction system is injective and does not have the capacity for multiple non-degenerate equilibria.
