Model: Distributive mechanism for both phosphorylation and dephosphorylation
The deficiency of the reaction network is 2.
The reaction network deficiency is greater than the sum of the deficiencies of its linkage classes, so Deficiency-One Theorem does not apply.
The reaction network with mass action or Michaelis-Menten kinetics is non-autocatalytic.
The stoichiometric matrix is not SSD. The reaction network has the capacity for multiple equilibria.
One set of species and reactions because of which the stoichiometric matrix is not SSD: 

ans = 

    'MAPKK'    'MAPK_MAPKK'    'MAPKp'


reaction_string =

1 MAPK_MAPKK -> 1 MAPK + 1 MAPKK


reaction_string =

1 MAPK_MAPKK -> 1 MAPKK + 1 MAPKp


reaction_string =

1 MAPKp_MAPKK -> 1 MAPKK + 1 MAPKp


i =

     2

Model: Processive mechanism for phosphorylation and distributive mechanism for dephosphorylation
The deficiency of the reaction network is 1.
The reaction network deficiency is greater than the sum of the deficiencies of its linkage classes, so Deficiency-One Theorem does not apply.
The network is regular and the Deficiency-One Algorithm determines that the reaction network with mass action kinetics does not admit multiple positive equilibria within a stoichiometric compatibility class.
The reaction network with mass action or Michaelis-Menten kinetics is non-autocatalytic.
The stoichiometric matrix is not SSD. The reaction network has the capacity for multiple equilibria.
One set of species and reactions because of which the stoichiometric matrix is not SSD: 

ans = 

    'MAPKp'    'phosphatase'    'MAPKpp_phosphatase'


reaction_string =

1 MAPKpp_phosphatase -> 1 MAPKpp + 1 phosphatase


reaction_string =

1 MAPKpp_phosphatase -> 1 MAPKp + 1 phosphatase

1 MAPKp_phosphatase -> 1 MAPKp + 1 phosphatase

The network is regular and the Deficiency-One Algorithm determines that the reaction network with mass action kinetics does not admit multiple positive equilibria within a stoichiometric compatibility class.
The reaction network with mass action or Michaelis-Menten kinetics is non-autocatalytic.
The stoichiometric matrix is SSD. With said kinetics, the Jacobian matrix of the system of ODEs is a P0(-) matrix, so the reaction system is injective and does not have the capacity for multiple non-degenerate equilibria.
