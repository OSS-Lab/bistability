The deficiency of the reaction network is 3.
There is some linkage class with deficiency > 1, so Deficiency-One Theorem does not apply.
The reaction network with mass action or Michaelis-Menten kinetics is non-autocatalytic.
The stoichiometric matrix is not SSD. The reaction network has the capacity for multiple equilibria.
One set of species and reactions because of which the stoichiometric matrix is not SSD:

The deficiency of the reaction network is 4.
There is some linkage class with deficiency > 1, so Deficiency-One Theorem does not apply.
The reaction network with mass action or Michaelis-Menten kinetics is non-autocatalytic.
The stoichiometric matrix is SSD. With said kinetics, the Jacobian matrix of the system of ODEs is a P0(-) matrix, so the reaction system is injective and does not have the capacity for multiple non-degenerate equilibria.

The deficiency of the reaction network is 1.
The reaction network deficiency is greater than the sum of the deficiencies of its linkage classes, so Deficiency-One Theorem does not apply.
The network is regular and the Deficiency-One Algorithm determines that the reaction network with mass action kinetics does not admit multiple positive equilibria within a stoichiometric compatibility class.
The reaction network with mass action or Michaelis-Menten kinetics is autocatalytic.
In the SR graph the following cycle is neither an o-cycle nor an s-cycle:
A -(1 A + 1 B,1)-> A+B<->2A -(2 A,2)-> A
The reaction network has the capacity for multiple equilibria.

The reaction network deficiency is greater than the sum of the deficiencies of its linkage classes, so Deficiency-One Theorem does not apply.
The network is regular and the Deficiency-One Algorithm determines that the reaction network with mass action kinetics admits multiple positive equilibria within a stoichiometric compatibility class. For example for the rate constants
