>> The deficiency of the reaction network is 5.
There is some linkage class with deficiency > 1, so Deficiency-One Theorem does not apply.
The reaction network with mass action or Michaelis-Menten kinetics is non-autocatalytic.
The stoichiometric matrix is SSD. With said kinetics, the Jacobian matrix of the system of ODEs is a P0(-) matrix, so the reaction system is injective and does not have the capacity for multiple non-degenerate equilibria.
