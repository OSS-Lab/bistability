The deficiency of the reaction network is 1.
The reaction network deficiency is greater than the sum of the deficiencies of its linkage classes, so Deficiency-One Theorem does not apply.
The network is regular and the Deficiency-One Algorithm determines that the reaction network with mass action kinetics admits multiple positive equilibria within a stoichiometric compatibility class. For example for the rate constants

constants =

  722.1847

The reaction network with mass action or Michaelis-Menten kinetics is autocatalytic.
In the SR graph the following cycle is neither an o-cycle nor an s-cycle:
A1 -(1 A1,1)-> A1<->2A1 -(2 A1,2)-> A1
The reaction network has the capacity for multiple equilibria.

i =

     2

The reaction network is weakly reversible and has deficiency 0, so with mass action kinetics each positive stoichiometric compatibility class contains precisely one equilibrium, which is asymptotically stable.
The reaction network with mass action or Michaelis-Menten kinetics is non-autocatalytic.
The stoichiometric matrix is SSD. With said kinetics, the Jacobian matrix of the system of ODEs is a P0(-) matrix, so the reaction system is injective and does not have the capacity for multiple non-degenerate equilibria.

The reaction vectors are not positively dependent, so the reaction network has no positive equilibria (at least one species is 0 at equilibrium).
The reaction network is not weakly reversible and has deficiency 0, so it has neither a positive equilibrium, nor a positive periodic orbit.
The reaction network with mass action or Michaelis-Menten kinetics is non-autocatalytic.
The stoichiometric matrix is SSD. With said kinetics, the Jacobian matrix of the system of ODEs is a P0(-) matrix, so the reaction system is injective and does not have the capacity for multiple non-degenerate equilibria.

The deficiency of the reaction network is 1.
