ERNEST installation instructions
--------------------------------

ERNEST requires Mathworks MATLAB and Mathworks Optimization Toolbox.

To install ERNEST just unpack the archive, then add the ERNEST directory 
to your MATLAB search path. One possibility is to add to your startup.m 
file the following line:

addpath('PATH/TO/ERNEST');

where PATH/TO/ERNEST is the path to the ERNEST directory.
For info about startup.m and other ways to add the directory to your 
search path, please consult the MATLAB documentation.

To use the toolbox with SBML models, you have to install the libSBML 
library. You need to configure it with the --with-matlab option. For 
detailed instructions, see http://sbml.org/Software/libSBML .
