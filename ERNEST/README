ERNEST Reaction Network Equilibria Study Toolbox
------------------------------------------------

The installation instructions are in the file INSTALL.

The main ERNEST function is model_analysis. Another useful function is 
model_ma_supports_given_equilibria. All the other functions are just
dependencies, but they can also be applicable to quite different contexts, 
like graph theory.

Each function is documented in the relative file, and its usage 
information is available through the usual MATLAB help system.

Example
-------

To analyze a SBML file MODEL.sbml, simply execute in MATLAB:

model = TranslateSBML('MODEL.sbml');
model_analysis(model);

In the examples/ subdirectory there are some examples of chemical 
reaction networks taken from literature to test.
