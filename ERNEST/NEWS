ERNEST 1.4 (2009-10-27)
 - Corrected a bug in @umultigraph/walk2graph and @umultigraph/spanning_forest
   where the call to @umultigraph/umultigraph function was not respecting the
   stricter type checking introduced in ERNEST 1.2 . Thanks to prof. Gregory
   D. Smith for the bug report
 - Corrected a bug in the creation of a directed multigraph from vertex and
   edge sets
 - Added a display function for directed multigraphs
 - Added graph2matrix function for directed and undirected multigraphs
 - Added a new script examples/example6.m with examples from Angeli,
   De Leenheer, Sontag ()
 - Added an output file for each example

ERNEST 1.3 (2009-09-10)
 - Completely rewritten sns function: the previous version could return 
   1 even if the matrix was not SNS because of the use of a wrong 
   determinant expansion. The new version instead use row signings as 
   suggested in Klee, Ladner, Manber - Linear Algebra Appl., 1984. 
   Thanks to Christoph Flamm and Stefan MÃ¼ller for the bug report

ERNEST 1.2 (2009-09-07)
 - removed unused @multigraph/add_edge.m
 - added a README file
 - better help documentation for all the functions
 - stricter type checking in @multigraph/multigraph and
   @umultigraph/umultigraph functions

ERNEST 1.1 (2009-08-10)
 - in model_analysis function, when Deficiency One algorithm determines 
   that the reaction network with mass action kinetics admits multiple 
   equilibria, added as additional output an example of reaction rate 
   constants and 2 equilibria
 - in model_analysis function, when the stoichiometric matrix is not 
   SSD, added as additional output a set of species and reactions 
   causing this
 - in model_analysis function, do not run Deficiency One algorithm if 
   the network does not satisfy first condition of regularity (R.1)
 - model_analysis function now returns a struct with some of the 
   analysis results
 - new function model_ma_supports_given_equilibria which verifies if a 
   model with mass action kinetics supports a given set of equilibria by 
   searching for compatible reaction rate constants
 - added new script examples/example5.m with examples from Schlosser, 
   Feinberg (1994)
