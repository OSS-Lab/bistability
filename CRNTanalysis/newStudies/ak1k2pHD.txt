      Taken with mass action kinetics, the network MIGHT have the capacity for
 multiple steady states and for a degenerate steady state. (To test for
 rate constants that give a degenerate steady state, use the Zero Eigenvalue
 Problem entry on the Advanced Deficiency Menu.) The existence of multiple
 steady states can be tested with the mass action injectivity or concordance
 modules, if you have not already done so.
