Minimal bistable networks

Based on Jamie's idea, I start to analysis very simple allosteric network.
I didn't analytically solve them, althought it would be interesting to do so
(undergoing).

Minimal system (minimal-system-allo)
A <---> B*   (<---> binding, * allosteric)
- there is no capacity for mutlistationary.

minimal-system-extend1
A* <---> B*
- this is not bistable

minimal-system-extend2
A <---> B* ---> O  (---> phosphorylation)
- this is not bistable, there is no positive steady state.

minimal-system-extend3
A <---> B* ---> O |--- P (---| dephosphorylation)
- this is bistable both for complexSizeThreshold of 2
  (minimal-system-extendminimal-system-extend3.net) and 3
  (minimal-system-extend3-maxComp3.net)

minimal-system-extend4
A <---> K ---> O |--- P
- this is not bistable for complexSizeThreshold of 2
- for maxComp3: there is capacity for multiple steady states but examples are two steady states: one is unstable the other is stable.

minimal-system-extend4-mutant1
A <---> K ---> O, Op ---> O
- For complex size 2: Can not admit bistable property.
- For complex size 3: This structure allows system reach bistable regime.

minimal-system-extend5
B <---> A <---> K ---> O |--- P
- this is not bistable for complexSizeThreshold of 2
- for maxComp3: there is capacity for multiple steady states but examples are two steady states: one is unstable the other is stable.

minimal-system-extend6 (previously analyzed network in our evolved networks)
B <---> A <---> K* ---> O |--- P
- this is bistable for maxComp2
- for maxComp3: the CRNT software can not handle it. (very likely to be bistable)

Based on the paper "Cellular Compartments Cause Multistability and Allow Cells
to Process More Information", it seems shuttling from different compartments
is very like MWC allosteric model in terms of protein's states. I will put
some of those system here to analysis it later.

minimal-system-extend7
K ---> O |--- P
- this network cannot admit multiple steady states.

minimal-system-extend8
K* ---> O |--- P
- there is capacity for multiple steady states, in the example
  steady states one is stable and the other is unstable.

minimal-system-extend8-mutant1
K* ---> O,  Op ---> O
- there is capacity for this network to be bistable.

minimal-system-extend9   !!!
K* ---> O |--- P*
- might have the capacity for multiple steady states. It's very strange that
  higher dificiency report doesn't tell affirmative existence of multistationary.

minimal-system-extend10
K ---> O* |--- P
- there is capacity for multiple steady states, in the example
  steady states one is stable and the other is unstable.

minimal-system-extend10-mutant1
K ---> O*, Op* ---> O*
- this structure can allow the systems reach bistable regime.

minimal-system-extend11
K ---> O <---> A, P ---| O
- For complex size 2: can not admit multiple positive steady states
- For complex size 3: can have multiple steady states, but in examples, there
  is one steady state is unstable.

minimal-system-extend11-mutant1
K ---> O <---> A, Op ---> O
- For complex size 2: can not admit multiple positive steady states
- For complex size 3: can have multiple steady states, but in examples, there
  is one steady state is unstable.


Part 2: One minimal network in evolved networks.

In last discussion, we found one network is even simpler with bistable
response. In this system A is allosteric but with binding domain with L, both
kinase domain and phosphotase domain with O.

min-low-com4-sim6-G234
L <---> A* --->O; L <---> A* ---| O
- for maxComp3: the CRNT software cannot handle it.
- for maxComp2: the CRNT seems unable to handle it.

min-low-com4-sim6-G234-mutant1   !!!
A* ---> O; A* ---| O
- might have the capacity for multiple steady states. It's very strange that
  higher dificiency report doesn't tell affirmative existence of multistationary.

min-low-com4-sim6-G234-mutant2
L <---> A ---> O; L <---> A ---| O
- for maxComp3: there is capacity for multiple steady states, in the example
  steady states: one is stable and the other is unstable.
- for maxComp2: not bistable (there is only exact one steady state)
