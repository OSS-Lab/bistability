 The network is weakly reversible but not reversible.
 
 The network is conservative. (There exists a positive vector
 orthogonal to all reaction vectors.)

     This is a weakly reversible deficiency zero network. The DEFICIENCY
 ZERO THEOREM gives the following information: For ANY assignment of pos-
 itive rate constants to the individual reactions, the corresponding mass
 action differential equations admit PRECISELY ONE steady state (in each
 positive stoichiometric compatibility class); that steady state is
 ASYMPTOTICALLY STABLE; and there are NO CYCLIC COMPOSITION TRAJECTORIES.
