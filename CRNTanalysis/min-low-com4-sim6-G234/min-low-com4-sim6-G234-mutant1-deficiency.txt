      Taken with mass action kinetics, the network MIGHT have the capacity for
 multiple steady states. To determine whether the network might admit two
 distinct stoichiometrically compatible positive equilibria, you should also
 consult the mass action injectivity or concordance report if you haven't
 already done so. (To test for rate constants that give a degenerate steady
 state, consult the Zero Eigenvalue Report.)
