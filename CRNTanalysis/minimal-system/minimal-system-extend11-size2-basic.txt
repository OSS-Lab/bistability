 The network is conservative. (There exists a positive vector
 orthogonal to all reaction vectors.)

     This is a regular deficiency one network. It is an excellent candi-
 date for application of DEFICIENCY ONE THEORY.
 
     Deficiency one theory will determine, either affirmatively or nega-
 tively, whether there are positive rate constant values such that the corre-
 sponding mass action differential equations admit multiple (positive) steady
 states. If the answer is affirmative, deficiency one theory will generate a
 sample set of rate constants and a pair of distinct steady states that are
 consistent with those rate constants. To get this informatoin, you should
 run the Deficiency One Report.
 
     Deficiency one theory will also determine, either affirmatively or
 negatively, whether there can exist a set of rate constants such that the
 corresponding mass action differential equations admit a positive steady
 state having a zero eigenvalue (corresponding to an eigenvector in the
 stoichiometric subspace).  When the answer is affirmative, the theory will
 produce such a set of rate constants, a positive steady state, and an
 eigenvector (in the stoichiometric subspace) corresponding to an eigenvalue
 of zero. To get this information, run the Zero Eigenvalue Report (after
 running the Deficiency Zero Report).
