      Taken with mass action kinetics, the network DOES have the capacity for
 multiple steady states. That is, there are rate constants that give rise
 to two or more positive (stoichiometrically compatible) steady states --
 you'll see an example below. There MIGHT also exist rate constants for which
 there is a steady state having an eigenvector (in the stoichiometric subspace)
 corresponding to an eigenvalue of zero. (To try to construct rate constants
 that give a degenerate steady state, use the Zero Eigenvalue Report.)
 
 
 A mass action system example is also given below:
 
 
 
 
                     Example No. 1: Multiple Steady States
                     ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
 
      The following mass action system gives rise to multiple steady states:
 
 
                          K + OR ---315592.38-> K_OR
                            K_OR ---2410.4537-> K + OR
                            K_OR ---25.834767-> K + ORp
                            K_OR ---25.834767-> K_OT
                            K_OT ---24.519975-> K_OR
                            K_OT ---9.1633376-> K + OT
                            K_OT -------1-----> K + OTp
                          K + OT ---777475.15-> K_OT
                              OR ---83.527708-> OT
                              OT ---1.353608--> OR
                             ORp ---10.107337-> OR
                             ORp ---5.0861612-> OTp
                             OTp ---2.3259189-> OT
                             OTp ---6.3225032-> ORp
 
 
      The steady states shown below are both consistent with the mass
 action system indicated.
