 The network is conservative. (There exists a positive vector
 orthogonal to all reaction vectors.)

                                    Analysis
                                    ========
 
     This is a deficiency 10 network. It is  candidate for application
 of HIGHER DEFICIENCY THEORY (tailored mostly to networks with deficien-
 cies greater than one).
 
     Whether results will be obtained, will depend on whether or not the reaction 
 network has certain additional structural attributes that help reduce the problem
 to a study of systems of linear inequalities.
 
     If a network is "good", higher deficiency theory will determine, either
 affirmatively or negatively, whether there are positive rate constant values
 such that the corresponding mass action differential equations admit multiple 
 (positive) steady states. If the answer is affirmative, higher deficiency
 theory will generate a sample set of rate constants and a pair of distinct
 steady states that are consistent with those rate constants.
 
     If a network is "bad", some additional nonlinear analysis might be required,
 and the program might not be able to ascertain the network's capacity for
 multiple  positive steady states. If definite conclusions can be reached they
 they will be reported. Otherwise the program will tell you that it cannot reach
 a conclusion.
 
     Higher deficiency theory will also determine, either affirmatively or
 negatively, whether there can exist a set of rate constants such that the
 corresponding mass action differential equations admit a positive steady
 state having a zero eigenvalue (corresponding to an eigenvector in the
 stoichiometric subspace).  When the answer is affirmative, the theory will
 produce such a set of rate constants, a positive steady state, and an
 eigenvector (in the stoichiometric subspace) corresponding to an eigenvalue
 of zero. Results of this kind are contained after running the Zero Eigenvalue
 Report.
