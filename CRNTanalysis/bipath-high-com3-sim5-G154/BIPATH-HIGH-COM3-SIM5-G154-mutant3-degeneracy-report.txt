     The network entered is nondegenerate. For at least one assignment of
 differentiably monotonic kinetics, the derivative of the species formation
 rate function is nonsingular (relative to the stoichiometric subspace) at
 EVERY positive composition, not just equilibria. If the network's fully
 open extension is concordant, then at EVERY positive composition the
 derivative of the species formation rate function will be nonsingular for
 EVERY assignment of differentiably monotonic kinetics.
